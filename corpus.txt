Once upon a time, in a land far, far away,there was a beautiful young girl who hadbecome lost while traveling. As the sun setand the moon rose, she happened upon asplendid castle. After knocking on themassive doors and being brought inside, shefound out that this was the castle of the kingof the country she had been passingthrough. The king came to see the visitor.After exchanging greetings, the girl claimedto be a princess of a neighboring countryand asked for royal treatment. The kingsought the advice of his trusted counselors,who suggested putting her to a test. As itwas very late at night and the girl was tired,they prepared a bedroom for the girl thatwould reveal the validity of her claim toroyalty. Unbeknownst to the girl, they placed a pea under a mattress and then put 9more mattresses on top. The young girl was then helped to the top of the mattressesand wished pleasant dreams. When the sun came up, the counselors came to the roomand asked her how she slept. The girl said that she hadn't slept at all and that she hadfelt an annoying irritation that kept her awake all through the night. This was theproof the counselors had been looking for, because only a royal being could besensitive enough to be aware of a pea under ten mattresses. The king was elated andoffered the princess his son's hand in marriage and thus the kingdom. The princessfound the prince the most wonderful, handsome, wise man in the world and quicklyaccepted. They married and lived happily ever after. Once upon a time, in a land far away, there was a little village. The village was home to many people, animals, and wonderful tales. Every day, something new would happen, and every night, people gathered to share their stories.
